# SLB Generic Simulation Grid (GSG) file format 
The GSG file format is primarily utilized in SLB reservoir simulators for efficient reading and writing processes. The new reservoir Intersect simulator employs the .gsg file format as a restart file. This project aims to develop C++ and MATLAB functions to extract and overwrite the restart files of this simulator. 

## To-do list
At this moment, the file can only read and write properties in the .gsg file format. In the future, additional functionality, such as reading and writing the simulation grid, will be added.
